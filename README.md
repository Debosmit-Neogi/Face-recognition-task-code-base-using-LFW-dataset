# Face-recognition-task-code-base-using-LFW-dataset

This repository contains all the code and results of the experiments conducted during my research internship at **Visual Computing Lab, IISC Bangalore**. The experiments comprise of various state of the art algorithms.

I have started my experiments by using the most popular light weight face recognition library **Deep Face** (https://github.com/serengil/deepface). 

P.S: 

1. The codes may or may not be properly documented

2. These are merely experimental results. So follow the notebooks with a pinch of salt.
