# Face-recognition-task-code-base-using-LFW-dataset

This repository contains all the code and results of the experiments conducted during my research internship at **Visual Computing Lab, IISC Bangalore**. My objective was to implement various face recognition algorithms on the **LFW Dataset** (http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) and perform comparative studies on the result metrics obtained.

~ I started my experiments by using the most popular light weight face recognition library **Deep Face** (https://github.com/serengil/deepface). 

      **  The models used were VGG-Face and Arc-Face 
      
      **  

P.S: 
 1. The codes may or may not be sufficiently documented.

2. These are merely experimental results. So follow the Colab notebooks (Provided in the **Code** directory) with a pinch of salt.
